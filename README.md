# time-of-day

http://courses.oreillyschool.com/csharp4/intro_web_dev_overview.html

Create a new web project called TimeOfDay. This project will prompt the user for their name (Name) using a TextBox control, and then based on the time of day, display either "Good morning, Name," "Good afternoon, Name," or "Good evening, Name." You will need to include a Button control just as we did in the HelloWorld project, and a Label control to display the greeting. The project should also display at the top of the webpage the current date and time using a Label control, and should be called from the Page_Load event.

Save your project and test it to make sure it works. Your source code should have no errors or warnings.
